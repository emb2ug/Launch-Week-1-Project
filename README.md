Launch Week 1 Project

Restaurant Finder App:

This app allows a user to enter the type of food they're looking for (ex. "pizza" or "breakfast"), as well as a location.
The location can be as specific as a street address or as vague as a city name.

The app will return a list of up to 20 results that match the user's search (within a small radius of the entered location), with each restaurant's name, rating (out of 5), and price level.
This list is sorted by rating in descending order.

The app also displays a map with markers at each restaurant's location, which provide the restaurant name in a popup when the marker is clicked on.
